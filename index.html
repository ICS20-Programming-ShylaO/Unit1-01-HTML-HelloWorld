    <p>My name is Shyla O. and I am in grade 10, attending   Immaculata High School. Here you will find my favourite passtime and least favourite school subject.</p>
    <h2>My favourite passtime:</h2>
   <p>I like to play music! Most of the time, I play piano and   alto saxophone, but occasionally I play guitar. I have been playing piano for 6 years and alto saxophone for a year and a half.</p>

    <h2>My least favourite school subject:</h2>
    <p>I am a little particular with what classes I like. However, a class that I have always disliked is Phys. Ed. It is just unpleasant having to physically exert myself and then compose myself for my next classes. Also, I think that most Phys. Ed teachers are biased.</p>
