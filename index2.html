    <p style="text-align: center;">  If you ask 100 different people what the greatest invention was, most might say the wheel or the computer (true),<br> but I feel like one of the most impactful inventions of history was of the radio. It offers communication with<br> everyone, opinions shared globally. The happenings of the world, right at your fingertips. It is truly fantastic.<br> However, I find the history of the invention the most interesting, as we get to see the battle of two inventors.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">The struggle between Nikola Tesla and Guglielmo Marconi dates back to 1884 in the U.S., with Tesla<br> inventing the Tesla coil, harnessing the power to send radio waves. He also was granted patents for radio work. Meanwhile in England, Marconi was able to send and receive morse code signals from about 6 kilometres away, and was awarded the first patent of wireless telegraphy.  </p>
