    <p style="text-align: center;">  If you ask 100 different people what the greatest invention was, most might say the wheel or the computer (true),<br> but I feel like one of the most impactful inventions of history was of the radio. It offers communication with<br> everyone, opinions shared globally. The happenings of the world, right at your fingertips. It is truly fantastic.<br> However, I find the <b>history</b> of the radio the most interesting, as we get to see the battle of two inventors.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">The struggle between Nikola Tesla and Guglielmo Marconi dates back to 1884 in the U.S., with Tesla<br> inventing the Tesla coil, harnessing the power to send radio waves. He also was granted patents for radio work.<br> Meanwhile in England, Marconi was able to send and receive morse code signals from about 6 kilometres away,<br> and was awarded the first patent of wireless telegraphy.  </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Obviously, the story continues with twists and turns, but I'm not here to explain the details.<br>You'll find the real information here:
